Meanwhile, we are analyzing the physiological and molecular mechanism controlling plant developmental processes by the Biochemical methods.\r\n***\r\n### Our Specific Research Interests\r\n* Protein expression, Protein PTM and protein-protein interaction in rice in response to environmental stresses.\r\n* Development of Database and Bioinformatics Tools for:\r\nPredictions of protein phosphorylated sites in rice and Arabidopsis.\r\nPredictions of protein interaction network in rice and Arabidopsis in reponse to environmental stresses.\r\n* Physiological and molecular mechanisms controlling plant development processes.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n* [PhosphoRice (a meta-predictor of rice-specific Phosphorylation Site)](#)\r\nPhosphoRice,a meta-predictor of rice-specific phosphorylation site, was constructed by integrating the newly phosphorylation sites predictors, NetPhos2.0, NetPhosK, Kinasephos, Scansite, Disphos and Predphosphos with parameters selected by restricted grid search and random search. It archieve an increase in MCC of 7.1%, and an increase in ACC of 4.6% than that of the best element predictor (Disphos_default), respectively.\r\n* [PPIP (Protein - Protein Interaction Predictor)](#)\r\nInfer from homology.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n* Phone:0591-83710789\r\n* Email:hehq3@yahoo.com.cn\r\n* Address:College of Life Sciences,\r\n        Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University,Jinshan District,\r\n        Fuzhou,China.\r\n* Postcode:350002","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
